### Notes:
1. **Requirements File:** The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that your project depends on. You can create this file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` if you have already installed some packages in your environment.
2. **Version Control:** It is a good practice to include instructions for cloning the project if it's hosted in a repository.
3. **Additional Documentation:** Depending on the complexity of the project, you might also want to include documentation links or instructions on how to access generated docs, such as Sphinx for Python codebases.

This template should give you a good start for documenting your Django backend project in a way that is accessible and clear to new contributors or other developers.
